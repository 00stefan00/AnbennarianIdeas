# AI will consider buildings it does not have the tech for at 20% of scripted AI weight (in case it wants to save slots)

# Building AI is now mainly hard-coded. The AI will estimate how much it gains yearly from each building,
# convert the value to ducats, and take the building with biggest yearly return as a percentage of the build cost.
# If lower than 1%, the AI will not consider the yearly return worth it.
# It will also require higher yearly return if the economy in not in prime shape.
# Forts' value also get converted to a yearly return based on terrain and strategic position, as well as available budget for fort maintenance.

# AI can still be modded though; it will multiply the yearly return with the value of ai_will_do.
# If you don't want the AI to build a building at all, make ai_will_do become 0.
# AI will consider each building to be worth 0.01 ducats per year as a base, so making ai_will_do above cost will have them build it at some point.
# It will still check whether it can afford a building before doing so though, but may save up to it.

# for University Hard coded AI sees no value in this above the 0.01 ducats base. Let's multiply that

# Known issues with AI
# AI don't see a value in free building slot that comes with a building, if AI is trying to replace it with something else he will stop functioning.
# Triggers & Ai will do values needs to be the same for every building of the same type.
# Floating modifiers can cause issues, because AI can replace buildings.
